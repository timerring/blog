&lt;p>We will explore the crucial differences between the standard &lt;em>public network&lt;/em> backbones, like the workhorse 163 network, and premium, optimized lines like CN2. We&amp;rsquo;ll also explain what &lt;em>dedicated networks&lt;/em> such as IPLC are and why they offer a completely different level of performance and privacy. By the end of this article, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a clear framework for understanding these circuits, helping you make more informed decisions whether you&amp;rsquo;re choosing a hosting provider, diagnosing network issues, or are simply curious about how the internet infrastructure in mainland China operates.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
