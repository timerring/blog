&lt;p>GnuPG is a complete and free implementation of the OpenPGP standard as defined by RFC4880(also known as PGP). GnuPG allows you to encrypt and sign your data and communications; it features a versatile key management system, along with access modules for all kinds of public key directories. GnuPG, also known as GPG, is a command line tool with features for easy integration with other applications.&lt;/p>
